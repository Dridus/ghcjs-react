# ghcjs-react

React.js for GHCJS. Actually used in production.

## Contributing

Please do! I'll take all of the help I can get.

## Stability

Not very. The project is evolving based on my needs, and I wasn't exactly a React expert before starting this.

That being said, the fact that this is being used in production means that the changes are based on real-world usage
and aren't just an optimistic navel-gazing hobby project. Feel free to join the functional programming Slack community
and hop into the #ghcjs channel to keep abreast of development conversations or file issues if I'm messing with your
mojo.

## But why use Haskell on the frontend?
